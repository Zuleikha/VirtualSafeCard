## Technical Infrastructure for a Virtual Card System - Core Components

Based on research into existing virtual card issuing platforms like Stripe Issuing and general architectural principles for financial technology, the following core components are essential for a virtual card system:

1.  **User Management & Authentication Module:**
    *   **User Registration & Onboarding:** Secure process for new users to sign up, including identity verification (KYC - Know Your Customer) as per regulatory requirements.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Robust mechanisms for users to log in (e.g., multi-factor authentication - MFA) and manage their accounts. Role-based access control if different user types or administrative roles exist.
    *   **Profile Management:** Allows users to manage their personal information, notification preferences, and linked funding sources.

2.  **Wallet & Funding Management Module:**
    *   **Digital Wallet:** A secure system to hold user funds that will be used for virtual card transactions. This includes maintaining balances and transaction history for each user.
    *   **Funding Source Integration:** APIs and processes to allow users to add funds to their wallets using various methods (as specified by the user: PayPal, bank transfers, other digital payment methods). This requires integration with payment gateways and potentially banking APIs.
    *   **Balance Management:** Real-time tracking of wallet balances, including deposits, withdrawals (if applicable), and funds allocated to virtual cards.

3.  **Virtual Card Issuance & Management Module:**
    *   **Card Generation Engine:** System to programmatically create unique virtual card numbers (PANs), expiry dates, and CVVs. This typically involves integration with a card issuing processor (e.g., Visa, Mastercard via an API provider like Stripe, Marqeta, or directly if licensed).
    *   **Card Lifecycle Management:** Functionality to issue, activate, suspend, unsuspend, and terminate virtual cards.
    *   **Card Controls & Customization:**
        *   **Spending Limits:** Allow users to define spending limits per card (e.g., per transaction, daily, monthly, total).
        *   **Single-Use vs. Multi-Use:** Option for users to create cards for one-time purchases or for ongoing use.
        *   **Merchant Locking (Optional):** Ability to restrict card usage to specific merchants or merchant categories.
        *   **Recurring Payment Support:** Features to support cards used for subscriptions.
    *   **Card Data Security:** Secure storage and retrieval of sensitive card information (though ideally, full PANs are not stored by the platform itself but tokenized by the processor, adhering to PCI DSS).

4.  **Transaction Processing & Authorization Module:**
    *   **Real-time Authorization Engine:** A system that receives authorization requests from card networks (via the issuer processor) when a virtual card is used for a purchase.
    *   **Decision Logic:** Validates the transaction against card status, available funds/limits, security rules, and fraud checks.
    *   **Ledger Management:** Accurately records all transactions, updates user wallet balances, and reflects changes in card spending.
    *   **Notification System:** Informs users of transaction activity in real-time (e.g., via push notifications, SMS, email).

5.  **Security & Fraud Prevention Module:**
    *   **Compliance with PCI DSS:** If handling cardholder data, strict adherence to PCI DSS requirements. Leveraging a compliant issuer processor can significantly reduce this burden.
    *   **Data Encryption:** Encryption of sensitive data both in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest.
    *   **Fraud Detection & Prevention Engine:** Tools and algorithms to monitor transactions for suspicious activity, implement velocity checks, and flag or block potentially fraudulent transactions.
    *   **KYC/AML Integration:** Integration with KYC/AML service providers for identity verification and ongoing monitoring as per regulatory obligations.
    *   **Access Controls & Audit Logs:** Strict access controls for internal systems and comprehensive audit trails of all system activities and user actions.

6.  **Integration Layer & APIs:**
    *   **Internal APIs:** For communication between the different modules of the platform (e.g., frontend applications, backend services).
    *   **External APIs:**
        *   **Card Issuing Processor API:** To create and manage virtual cards (e.g., Stripe Issuing API, Marqeta API).
        *   **Payment Gateway APIs:** To process incoming funds from users (e.g., PayPal API, Stripe Payments API, Plaid for bank transfers).
        *   **KYC/AML Provider APIs:** For identity verification services.
        *   **Notification Service APIs:** For sending SMS, email, or push notifications.

7.  **Administration & Reporting Module:**
    *   **Admin Dashboard:** A backend interface for system administrators to manage users, monitor system health, handle customer support issues, manage risk, and generate reports.
    *   **Reporting & Analytics:** Tools to generate reports on transaction volumes, user activity, revenue, system performance, and compliance.

8.  **User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Layer:**
    *   **Web Application:** For users to manage their accounts, create virtual cards, view transactions, and add funds.
    *   **Mobile Applications (iOS & Android):** Offering a native mobile experience is common for such services, providing convenience and features like push notifications and biometric authentication.
    *   **API for Developers (Optional):** If the platform intends to offer B2B services or allow third-party integrations.

Building such a system requires careful consideration of partnerships, particularly with card issuing processors and payment gateways, as these can significantly impact the technical complexity, regulatory burden, and time to market.
